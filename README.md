This File serves as the Readme for 'Take It Easy' - The Frontend.

This project was part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive - clas of SEI55 - and the final project of said immersive. Each project followed the same timeframe of one week given to complete the project.

Our frontend for this project was created using React and assorted JavaScript, with Boostrap .CSS. 

We wanted to create an Airtasker clone, and prioritise functionality first in the limited time available.
